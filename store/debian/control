 When installed alongside cockpit-container-apps, it enables a curated
 view of marine and sailing applications including navigation software,
 chart plotters, weather routing, data logging, and monitoring dashboards.

 The store filters packages from apt.hatlabs.fi and other repositories
 based on Debian tags (debtags), sections, and package metadata.
