Description: Marine container application store definition for Cockpit APT
 This package provides the store definition and branding for the Marine
 container application store, designed to work with cockpit-apt.

 When installed alongside cockpit-apt, it enables a curated view of marine
 and sailing applications including navigation software, chart plotters,
 weather routing, data logging, and monitoring dashboards.

 The store filters packages from apt.hatlabs.fi and other repositories
 based on Debian tags (debtags), sections, and package metadata.
