# HaLOS Marine Containers

Marine container store definition and curated marine application definitions for HaLOS.

## What's in This Repository

This repository contains:

1. **Store Definition** (`store/`): Configuration and branding for the Marine container store
   - Installs to `/etc/container-apps/stores/marine.yaml` on target systems
   - Provides filtering rules, section metadata, and branding

2. **Marine App Definitions** (`apps/`): Curated marine applications packaged as containers
   - Signal K server
   - OpenCPN chartplotter
   - InfluxDB (for marine data logging)
   - Grafana (for marine data visualization)
   - And more...

## Build Output

CI/CD builds multiple Debian packages from this repository:
- `marine-container-store` - Store definition package
- `signalk-server-container` - Signal K marine data server
- `opencpn-container` - OpenCPN chartplotter
- etc.

All packages are published to apt.hatlabs.fi.

## Agentic Coding Setup (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.)

For development with AI assistants, use the halos-distro workspace for full context:

```bash
# Clone the workspace
git clone https://github.com/halos-org/halos-distro.git
cd halos-distro

# Get all sub-repositories including halos-marine-containers
./run repos:clone

# Work from workspace root for AI-assisted development
# Claude Code gets full context across all repos
```

See `halos-distro/docs/` for development workflows:
- `LIFE_WITH_CLAUDE.md` - Quick start guide
- `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Development checklist
- `DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` - Detailed workflows
